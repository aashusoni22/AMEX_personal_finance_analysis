# AMEX_personal_finance_analysis

**Dataset used:** Personal credit statement 2021 from AMEX. 

**Goal/Objective:** To analyze spending trends and to find ways to live healthy life by sending money on right stuff.

**Major Insights** found through visualization: In 2021, I have spent most money on online food orders and on groceries. When comparing my online & In-store purchases, I like to buy things online rather than in-store. From credit limit of $15600 (yearly) I have only used 46.2% of the limit which is $7216. So, from overall trends which I have found I think to live a healthy life I should avoid online food ordering and go to grocery store to buy stuff that can lead to a small walk and heathy homemade food. Same applies to online/In-store purchases as well.  


**Analysis Steps:**

- Extracted credit statements for 2021 from the personal Amex account and performed data exploration and data cleaning in Excel. 

- Created a new column to categorize each item into four categories Purchase, Payment, Cashback, and Interest using IF NESTED.

- Analyzed cleaned data using SQL to calculate the total spend for each item, in order to compare online vs In-store purchases, online food orders vs groceries and other insightful comparisons.

- Finally, visualized data using Tableau to draw insights such as, on which item I have spent the most money, the total amount used out of the total limit, the interest    charged and many more
