*PROJECT BREAKDOWN*

**Goal:** To live healthy lifestyle by spending money consciously on right things.

**Objective:** To analyze spending trends to find ways to build out healthy lifestyle.

**Questions to Answer in order to achieve the Goal:** 
- “On which item the most money has been spend in 2021? And does that fulfill the current Goal?” 
- “Where the credit card has been mostly used? Is it for in-store purchases or online?”
- “Where the credit card has been mostly used? Is it for online food order for fast food purchases or grocery store for healthy food?”
- “In total, how much money has been used from total yearly limit of $15600?”
- “Did the due payments were paid on time? If not, how much interest charged in 2021?”

**Data Exploration and Data Cleaning:**
- Extracted personal credit card statement from 2021 in CSV format to perform data analysis.
- Performed Data Exploration in Excel to get an overall idea about dataset and data type present.
- Executed Data Cleaning in Excel to aligned data, converted date to short date format and amount as numbers for ensuring data consistency.
- To better analyze data, cate gorized all items into three categories Purchased, Payment, Interest & Cash back using IF NESTED function in Excel.

**Data Extraction & Data Analysis:**
- Imported cleaned dataset into Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio for analyzing.
- Extracted data from dataset using SQL queries.
- Performed analysis using various SQL functions such as Aggregated functions – SUM, LIKE operator, CTEs, MONTH, YEAR, DISTINCT, GROUP BY, CASE WHEN, Aliases. 
- Created Views to form a virtual table to only use specific part of dataset to answer the question.

**Data Visualization:**
- Reviewing and evaluating developed data outputs generated by executing SQL Script.
- Performed Extract, Load & Transform (ELT) by extracting outputs from MYSQL Server and importing into Excel and then loading Excel file into Tableau for further         visualization/transformation. 
- Used Tableau Desktop to import .xlsx for data visualization.
- Visualized data by creating heat map, line charts for comparison and single row table for amounts.

**Major Insights found through visualization:** 
- In 2021, The most money was spent on online food orders.
- When comparing online & In-store purchases, most purchases were online rather than in-store.
- From credit limit of $15600 (yearly) only used 46.2% of the limit which is $7216. 
- So, by considering overall spending trend I think to live a healthy lifestyle I should avoid online food ordering and go to grocery store to buy stuff that can lead to a small walk and heathy homemade food. Same applies to online/In-store purchases as well.
